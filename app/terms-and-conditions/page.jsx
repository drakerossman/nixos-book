            that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to
            be bound by all of these Legal Terms. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH
                ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING
                THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</strong></p>
        <p>We will provide you with prior notice of any scheduled changes to the

            effective date of any changes, you agree to be bound by the modified
            terms.</p>
        <p>The Services are intended for users who are at least 13 years of age.
            All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside

            directly supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the Services. If

        <p>The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
            distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
            country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
            regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
            within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
            choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own

            the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate
            the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>
